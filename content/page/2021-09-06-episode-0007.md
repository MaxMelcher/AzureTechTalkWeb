## Summary

So in session we started our [Dapr](https://dapr.io) journey. Installing the CLI, setting up kubernetes on Azure (AKS) and then some intensive thinking how to split our application into Dapr components. 

The goal of the application should be to allow to submit feedback, e.g. of a session at a conference. Frank has an IoT MX Chip (IoT Dev Kit) that has two buttons and we want to submit a 'good' or 'bad' to an API and then come up with some basic subscriptions - everything the Dapr-way. 

Please don't laugh about our High Level Architecture:
