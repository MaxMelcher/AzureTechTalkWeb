## Summary

We finished Challenge 1. WE DID IT! 
We learned how to extract SQL Server performance counters from the VM and show it on a dashboard in Azure. Also for CPU usage for Azure Scale Sets. 
We learned how to create alerts and that you can add suppression rules (e.g. maintenance windows etc).

And then we waited until the email rules were triggered. 
We fiddled a little bit with Scale Sets custom scaling - even deleted on instance to get an alert earlier.

Kudos to Mo for setting this up!

Challenge 2 in two weeks.
