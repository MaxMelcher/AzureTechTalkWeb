## Summary

> Great work ;-) you have finished!

So we happened to finish Chapter 3 of the Azure Monitoring MicroHack! <b>Great learning</b>
* We will give feedback to the numbering of the challenges
* Some of the instructions were not really clear to us, maybe the wording needs to be improved or examples given how the outcome should look like. 
* The application is not deployed in an AKS cluster - send help, we were confused!

On the plus we learned how to use workbooks, client-side AppInsight page view tracking and again a little bit of troubleshooting. Max broke one server, Frank didn't notice :)
