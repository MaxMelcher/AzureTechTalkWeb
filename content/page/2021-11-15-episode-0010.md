## Summary

This is the fourth part of our Dapr streaming series and we are looking into a new state query capability for Dapr. Last time we tried to wrap our head around the concept and found out that if gonna query the feedbacks per session that we will have a hard time because we would need to cycle through the feedbacks somehow. But since the last update of Dapr there is a new functionality of querying a state store. So we switched our state store from Redis to MongoDB and tried to implement the query functionality. We got it working in the end but it was not the best solution because we had an issue with serialization of the state.

This is still our planned architecture:
