## Summary

We discussed how we want to host and run our website for this project. We used Azure Static Website and Hugo to quickly ship everything - hosting a performant and secure website has never been simpler.
Max learned that you can buy domains in MSDN subscriptions, and we registered [AzureTechTalk.net](AzureTechTalk.net). 
Lastly, we configured GitHub Actions to build and deploy the website - it worked on the second attempt, close to a world record.

The website will evolve continuously, stay tuned!
