## Summary

Frank gave an introduction about GitHub Codespaces - neat new capabilities for Developers. We will use it for our own website once the feature is available for everyone.

Then we started to deploy the [Azure Monitoring MicroHack](https://github.com/msghaleb/AzureMonitorHackathon)
 from our colleague [Mo Ghaleb](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mohghaleb/). We also looked at Bicep, the new Infrastructure as Code meta language, to deploy resources to Azure. 
Then we hit a bug and tried to make it work - the deployment was stuck on the very last resource. The Custom Script Extension was stuck, several attempts were needed to fix it and it got late. 

To be continued.
