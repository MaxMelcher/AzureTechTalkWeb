## Summary

We continue our [Dapr](https://dapr.io) journey and try to understand how state management works in this area. We get our first little test app running and get it to use state stores and write information there. In this process we also understand that Dapr needs the sidecar to start alongside the application or else you won't be able to leverage this. This took us some time in this episode but in the end we did manage it! HOORAY!
