## Summary

Already the third part of our Dapr journey so far and we are slowly picking up pace. I forgot to show the iteration of the architecture, which I want to take care of this week:
![High Level Architecture](/episode-0008/highlevel.png)

This time we decided to start changing the application first and had our share of defining endpoints for our backend API and to call that from our webpage. While doing this we also enabled Dapr debugging directly in Visual Studio Code and also had some fun with the live share feature which is awesome for our joint streams. In the end we also had a discussion about our state management. We are facing the issue how we want to design our feedback in the state store. At this point we don't have a clear answer yet but we agreed to brainstorm until the next meeting
